           square to the left. We subtract 1, and we get 31 (h5). The rook
           obviously can't move to h5, but we don't know that without doing
           a lot of annoying work. Sooooo, what we do is figure out a4's
           mailbox number, which is 61. Then we subtract 1 from 61 (60) and
           see what mailbox[60] is. In this case, it's -1, so it's out of
           bounds and we can forget it. You can see how mailbox[] is used
